## 🎯 Key Concepts Summary

### Values & Types
```javascript
const num = 42;              // Number
const text = "Hello";        // String
const flag = true;           // Boolean
const empty = null;          // Null (intentional emptiness)
const unknown = undefined;   // Undefined (no value assigned)
```

### Operators
```javascript
// Arithmetic
const sum = 10 + 5;          // 15
const diff = 10 - 5;         // 5
const product = 10 * 5;      // 50

// Comparison
if (10 > 5) { }              // true
if (10 === "10") { }         // false (strict equality)

// Logical
if (x > 5 && y < 10) { }     // AND
if (x > 5 || y < 10) { }     // OR
if (!flag) { }               // NOT
```

### Type Conversion
```javascript
const str = "42";
const num = Number(str);      // Convert to number: 42
const bool = Boolean(0);      // Convert to boolean: false
const back = String(num);     // Convert to string: "42"
```

## 🎓 Next Steps

After completing Week 1:

✅ **Week 1 is complete!**  
👉 **Move to [Week 2: Program Structure & Control Flow](../Week-2/README.md)**

Week 2 will teach you how to control the flow of your programs using conditionals and loops, allowing you to make decisions and repeat actions.

## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to memorize all the operators?**  
A: No! It's better to understand what they do. With practice, they become second nature.

**Q: Why is `===` important?**  
A: It prevents unexpected type conversions. Always use `===` for comparisons.

**Q: Where can I test my code?**  
A: Use browser DevTools (F12 in Chrome) or Node.js in terminal. Both work great!
