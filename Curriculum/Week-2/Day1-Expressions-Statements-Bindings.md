## 📚 THEORY SESSION (90 minutes)

### 1. Expressions vs Statements

#### What is an Expression?
An **expression** is a fragment of code that produces a value. It can be evaluated.

```javascript
// Examples of expressions
10 + 20                     // Produces: 30
"Hello" + " World"         // Produces: "Hello World"
3 < 5                       // Produces: true
typeof 42                   // Produces: "number"
console.log("test")        // Produces: undefined (but has side effect)
```

**Key Point:** Expressions can be used anywhere a value is expected.

---

#### What is a Statement?
A **statement** is an instruction that performs an action. It doesn't produce a value that you can use in other code.

```javascript
// Examples of statements (we'll learn these soon)
if (age > 18) {
    console.log("Adult");
}

let name = "Alice";           // Variable declaration statement

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);           // Loop statement
}
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Expression:** Produces a value → Can be used in assignments, calculations
- **Statement:** Performs action → Doesn't return a value (usually)

---

#### Expression Statements

An **expression statement** is a special combination: it's an expression that is used as a complete statement on its own line. The expression is evaluated, its result is computed, and then that result is discarded. Expression statements are important because they are the most common type of statement you'll write.

```javascript
// Expression statements: expressions used as standalone statements
console.log("Hello");         // Function call expression used as a statement
x = 5;                         // Assignment expression used as a statement
counter++;                     // Increment expression used as a statement

// These are expressions, but when written alone on a line,
// they become expression statements:
42;                            // Valid expression statement (but useless — value is discarded)
"Hello";                       // Valid but useless — the string is computed and thrown away
3 + 4;                         // Valid but useless — 7 is computed but not stored anywhere

// Useful expression statements (the ones you'll actually write):
alert("Welcome!");             // Function call — side effect: shows popup
console.log(result);           // Function call — side effect: prints to console
array.push(item);              // Method call — side effect: modifies array
```

**Why does this matter?** Understanding expression statements helps you see that JavaScript has a dual nature: some code produces values (expressions), and some code performs actions (statements). An expression statement bridges both — it's an expression that exists solely for its **side effect** (like printing to the console or modifying data), not for the value it produces.

**Side Effect Definition:** A **side effect** is any change that a piece of code makes to the outside world beyond just computing a value. Examples include: printing to the console, modifying a variable, writing to a file, or sending data over the network.

#### Real-World Analogy
Think of a recipe:
- **Expression:** "Measure 2 cups of flour" - produces a measurement
- **Statement:** "Preheat oven to 350°F" - performs an action

### 2. Bindings (Variables) - Storing Values

Variables are like named boxes 📦 that store values. When you need that value later, you just refer to the box name.

#### Three Ways to Declare Variables

```javascript
// ============================================
// METHOD 1: const (Constant - Preferred)
// ============================================
// Use this for values that DON'T change

const PI = 3.14159;
const firstName = "John";
const maxRetries = 3;

// PI = 3.14;  ❌ Error! Cannot reassign const

console.log(PI);           // Output: 3.14159
console.log(firstName);    // Output: John


// ============================================
// METHOD 2: let (Block-scoped Variable)
// ============================================
// Use this for values that WILL change

let counter = 0;
counter = 1;               // ✅ Allowed
counter = 2;               // ✅ Allowed

let age = 25;
age = 26;
age = 30;

console.log(counter);      // Output: 2
console.log(age);          // Output: 30


// ============================================
// METHOD 3: var (Legacy - AVOID)
// ============================================
// Old way of declaring variables - don't use

var x = 5;  // ❌ Try to avoid this
```

---

### 3. Naming Variables (Binding Names)

JavaScript has strict rules for variable names:

```javascript
// ✅ Valid names (Good practice)
let userName = "Alice";           // camelCase ✅
let user_name = "Bob";            // snake_case (avoid in JS)
let UserName = "Charlie";         // PascalCase (for classes)
let user123 = "Dave";             // Numbers okay (not first char)
let $ = 100;                      // $ allowed
let _ = "underscore";             // _ allowed

// ❌ Invalid names (Will cause errors)
let 123user = "Error";            // ❌ Can't start with number
let user-name = "Error";          // ❌ Hyphens not allowed
let user name = "Error";          // ❌ Spaces not allowed
let let = "Error";                // ❌ Reserved word
let if = "Error";                 // ❌ Reserved word
```

#### Naming Best Practices
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Unclear names
let x = 25;
let a = "John";
let d = [1, 2, 3];

// ✅ GOOD: Descriptive names
let userAge = 25;
let userName = "John";
let userScores = [1, 2, 3];
```

### 4. The Environment

The **environment** is the collection of all variables and their values that exist in your program at any moment.

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
let age = 30;
const city = "New York";

// Current environment:
// {
//   name: "Alice",
//   age: 30,
//   city: "New York"
// }

console.log(name);  // "Alice" - retrieved from environment
age = 31;           // Modified in environment

// Environment updated to:
// {
//   name: "Alice",
//   age: 31,
//   city: "New York"
// }
```

---

## ✅ PRACTICAL SESSION (90 minutes)

### Exercise 1.1: Using Variables in Calculations

**Objective:** Understand how variables store and retrieve values

```javascript
// Problem: Calculate total cost of items in a shopping cart

const itemPrice = 50;
const quantity = 3;
const taxRate = 0.18;     // 18% tax

// Calculate subtotal
let subtotal = itemPrice * quantity;
console.log("Subtotal: ₹" + subtotal);           // ₹150

// Calculate tax
let tax = subtotal * taxRate;
console.log("Tax (18%): ₹" + tax);               // ₹27

// Calculate total
let total = subtotal + tax;
console.log("Total Price: ₹" + total);           // ₹177
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Stores intermediate values (subtotal, tax)
- Builds complex calculation step by step
- Easy to modify (change itemPrice, recalculate)

---

### Exercise 1.2: Updating Variable Values

**Objective:** Understand how let allows reassignment

```javascript
// Problem: Track a bank account balance

let balance = 1000;
console.log("Initial balance: ₹" + balance);     // ₹1000

// Deposit money
balance = balance + 500;
console.log("After deposit: ₹" + balance);       // ₹1500

// Withdraw money
balance = balance - 200;
console.log("After withdrawal: ₹" + balance);    // ₹1300

// Quick update syntax
balance += 300;  // Same as: balance = balance + 300
console.log("After another deposit: ₹" + balance);  // ₹1600

balance -= 100;  // Same as: balance = balance - 100
console.log("Final balance: ₹" + balance);       // ₹1500
```

**Operator Shortcuts:**
```javascript
let x = 10;
x += 5;   // x = x + 5 → x = 15
x -= 3;   // x = x - 3 → x = 12
x *= 2;   // x = x * 2 → x = 24
x /= 4;   // x = x / 4 → x = 6
```

---

### Exercise 1.3: Understanding const vs let

**Objective:** Know when to use const vs let

```javascript
// ============================================
// Use const for values that never change
// ============================================

const PI = 3.14159;           // Universal constant
const MAX_USERS = 100;        // Configuration constant
const CURRENCY_SYMBOL = "₹";  // Fixed text

// All of these are errors:
// PI = 3.14;              ❌ Cannot reassign
// MAX_USERS = 150;        ❌ Cannot reassign


// ============================================
// Use let for values that will change
// ============================================

let score = 0;                // Score increases during game
score = 10;
score = 25;
score = 100;                  // ✅ All allowed

let userName = "Guest";       // User logs in
userName = "Alice";           // ✅ Update allowed
```

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Default to **const**
- Only use **let** if you know the value will change
- Never use **var**

---

### Exercise 1.4: Creating a Simple Program

**Objective:** Write a complete mini-program using variables

```javascript
/*
 * Problem: Movie ticket pricing system
 * Calculate total cost for a family going to a movie
 */

// Constants (don't change)
const TICKET_PRICE = 250;      // Price per ticket
const BOOKING_FEE = 20;        // Per booking fee
const DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE = 10; // Student discount

// Variables (change per customer)
let numberOfTickets = 4;
let studentCount = 1;

// Calculate prices
const fullPriceTickets = numberOfTickets - studentCount;
const studentTickets = studentCount;

let ticketCost = 
    (fullPriceTickets * TICKET_PRICE) + 
    (studentTickets * TICKET_PRICE * (1 - DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE / 100));

let totalCost = ticketCost + BOOKING_FEE;

// Display results
console.log("=== Movie Ticket Pricing ===");
console.log("Regular tickets: " + fullPriceTickets);
console.log("Student tickets: " + studentTickets);
console.log("Ticket cost: ₹" + ticketCost);
console.log("Booking fee: ₹" + BOOKING_FEE);
console.log("Total cost: ₹" + totalCost);
console.log("Per ticket average: ₹" + (totalCost / numberOfTickets).toFixed(2));
```

**Output:**
```
=== Movie Ticket Pricing ===
Regular tickets: 3
Student tickets: 1
Ticket cost: ₹925
Booking fee: ₹20
Total cost: ₹945
Per ticket average: ₹236.25
```

### Exercise 1.5: The Environment in Action

**Objective:** Trace how the environment changes throughout a program

```javascript
/*
 * Trace the environment changes:
 */

console.log("--- Step 1: Initial state ---");
const name = "Alice";
const initialBalance = 5000;
console.log("Environment: name=" + name + ", initialBalance=" + initialBalance);

console.log("\n--- Step 2: Open savings account ---");
let savingsBalance = 0;
console.log("Environment: savingsBalance=" + savingsBalance);

console.log("\n--- Step 3: First deposit ---");
savingsBalance = savingsBalance + 1000;
console.log("Environment: savingsBalance=" + savingsBalance);

console.log("\n--- Step 4: Second deposit ---");
savingsBalance = savingsBalance + 1500;
console.log("Environment: savingsBalance=" + savingsBalance);

console.log("\n--- Step 5: Withdraw ---");
savingsBalance = savingsBalance - 500;
console.log("Environment: savingsBalance=" + savingsBalance);

console.log("\n--- Final state ---");
console.log(name + " has ₹" + savingsBalance + " remaining");
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Expression:** Produces a value
   ```javascript
   10 + 20        // Expression: produces 30
   ```

2. **Statement:** Performs an action
   ```javascript
   let x = 10;    // Statement: creates binding
   ```

3. **Bindings (Variables):** Named storage for values
   ```javascript
   const PI = 3.14159;  // Constant (doesn't change)
   let counter = 0;     // Variable (can change)
   ```

4. **Environment:** Collection of all current bindings
   ```javascript
   // After these lines, environment contains:
   const name = "Alice";
   let age = 30;
   // { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
   ```
