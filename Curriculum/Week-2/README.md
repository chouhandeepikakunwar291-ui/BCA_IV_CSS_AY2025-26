## 📚 Week Overview

Week 2 teaches you how to control the flow of your programs using conditional statements and loops. You'll learn how to make decisions (if/else), repeat actions (while, do-while, for), and organize code into reusable functions. These are the fundamental building blocks for creating interactive applications.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Apply program structure and control flow concepts effectively
- Use conditional statements to make decisions
- Understand and implement different loop types
- Define and use functions to organize code
- Understand variable scope and function scope

## 🎯 Key Concepts Summary

### Conditional Statements
```javascript
// if statement
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("Adult");
}

// if/else
if (score >= 50) {
    console.log("Pass");
} else {
    console.log("Fail");
}

// if/else if/else chain
if (grade === 'A') {
    console.log("Excellent");
} else if (grade === 'B') {
    console.log("Good");
} else {
    console.log("Improve");
}

// Switch statement
switch (day) {
    case 'Monday':
        console.log("Start of week");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Other day");
}
```

### Loops
```javascript
// while loop
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

// do-while loop (executes at least once)
do {
    console.log("At least once");
} while (false);

// for loop (most common)
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// Loop control
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) break;           // Exit loop
    if (i === 2) continue;        // Skip iteration
}
```

### Functions
```javascript
// Traditional function
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Arrow function (concise)
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

// Function with body
const divide = (a, b) => {
    if (b === 0) return "Error";
    return a / b;
};

// Using function
const result = add(5, 3);  // 8
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using `var` instead of `const`/`let`**
   ```javascript
   ❌ var x = 5;      // Don't use var
   ✅ const x = 5;    // Use const
   ```

2. **Single `=` in conditions (assignment, not comparison)**
   ```javascript
   ❌ if (x = 5) { }   // This assigns 5 to x!
   ✅ if (x === 5) { } // This compares
   ```

3. **Forgetting `break` in switch statements**
   ```javascript
   ❌ case 'A': console.log("A"); case 'B': console.log("B"); // Falls through!
   ✅ case 'A': console.log("A"); break;
   ```

4. **Infinite loops**
   ```javascript
   ❌ while (true) { }  // This runs forever!
   ✅ while (i < 10) { i++; }  // With exit condition
   ```

5. **Variable scope issues**
   ```javascript
   ❌ let x = 5;
      if (x > 0) { let x = 10; }
      console.log(x);  // Still 5 (different scope)
   ```

## 💬 Quick Reference

### When to use which loop?
- **for loop:** When you know the exact number of iterations
- **while loop:** When checking a condition
- **do-while loop:** When you need to execute at least once

### Operators Quick Reference
```javascript
===     // Strict equality (use this!)
!==     // Strict inequality
&&      // Logical AND
||      // Logical OR
!       // Logical NOT
```
