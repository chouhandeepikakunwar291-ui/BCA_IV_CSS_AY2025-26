**Learning Outcomes:**
- Create JavaScript programs and classes with OOP principles
- Implement inheritance and polymorphism
- Understand encapsulation and access modifiers
- Build complex object hierarchies
- Apply design patterns effectively
- Create enterprise-grade applications

## 🎯 Key Concepts Summary

### Classes
```javascript
// Define a class
class Animal {
    // Constructor
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;  // Instance property
    }
    
    // Method
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
    }
    
    // Static method (belongs to class, not instance)
    static info() {
        console.log('This is an Animal class');
    }
    
    // Getter
    get displayName() {
        return `Animal: ${this.name}`;
    }
    
    // Setter
    set displayName(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

// Create instance
const dog = new Animal('Dog');
dog.speak();                    // "Dog makes a sound"
console.log(dog.displayName);   // "Animal: Dog"
Animal.info();                  // Call static method
```

### Inheritance
```javascript
// Extend a class
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Additional property
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name);           // Call parent constructor
        this.breed = breed;
    }
    
    // Override method
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks`);
    }
    
    // New method
    getBreed() {
        return this.breed;
    }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Labrador');
dog.speak();                    // "Buddy barks"
console.log(dog.getBreed());    // "Labrador"
console.log(dog instanceof Dog); // true
console.log(dog instanceof Animal); // true
```

### Polymorphism
```javascript
class Shape {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    area() {
        return 0;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    constructor(width, height) {
        super('Rectangle');
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    
    area() {
        return this.width * this.height;
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    constructor(radius) {
        super('Circle');
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    
    area() {
        return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
    }
}

// Use polymorphism
const shapes = [
    new Rectangle(5, 10),
    new Circle(7)
];

shapes.forEach(shape => {
    console.log(`${shape.name}: ${shape.area()}`);
});
```

### Encapsulation
```javascript
class BankAccount {
    #balance = 0;  // Private property (# prefix)
    
    constructor(owner) {
        this.owner = owner;
    }
    
    // Public method
    deposit(amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            this.#balance += amount;
        }
    }
    
    // Only way to access balance
    getBalance() {
        return this.#balance;
    }
}

const account = new BankAccount('Alice');
account.deposit(1000);
console.log(account.getBalance());  // 1000
// account.#balance;                // Error: private
```

## 📊 OOP Principles

| Principle | Definition | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Encapsulation** | Hide internal details | Private `#balance` field |
| **Abstraction** | Expose only necessary features | Public methods only |
| **Inheritance** | Reuse code through hierarchy | `Dog extends Animal` |
| **Polymorphism** | Same interface, different behavior | `area()` in different shapes |

## 🔄 Progression from Week 4

**Week 4 Recap:**
- You learned functional programming with map, filter, reduce

**Week 5 New Skills:**
- Organize code using classes and inheritance
- Use OOP principles for large systems
- Combine OOP with functional patterns
- Build reusable class hierarchies

**Key Difference:**
- **Functional:** Focus on what to do (transformation)
- **OOP:** Focus on what things are (objects and relationships)

**In Practice:** Use both!
```javascript
// OOP for structure
class Product {
    constructor(name, price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }
}

const products = [
    new Product('Laptop', 1000),
    new Product('Mouse', 25)
];

// Functional for transformation
const total = products
    .map(p => p.price)
    .reduce((sum, p) => sum + p, 0);
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting `new` keyword with classes**
   ```javascript
   ❌ const dog = Animal('Buddy');  // Missing new!
   ✅ const dog = new Animal('Buddy'); // Correct
   ```

2. **Not calling `super()` in subclass constructor**
   ```javascript
   ❌ class Dog extends Animal {
        constructor(name) { } // Missing super!
      }
   ✅ class Dog extends Animal {
        constructor(name) {
            super(name);
        }
      }
   ```

3. **Confusing instance and static methods**
   ```javascript
   const dog = new Dog('Buddy');
   dog.speak();           // ✅ Instance method
   Dog.speak();           // ❌ Wrong!
   Dog.info();            // ✅ Static method
   dog.info();            // ❌ Wrong!
   ```

4. **Exposing private data**
   ```javascript
   ❌ account.balance = -5000;  // No validation!
   ✅ account.deposit(5000);  // Use public method
   ```

5. **Not using inheritance when you should**
   ```javascript
   ❌ IdenticalCode in many classes
   ✅ Extract common code to parent class
   ```
