## 🔍 Interview Preparation

### Common JavaScript Questions

**Q1: What is hoisting?**  
A: Variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope during compilation.

**Q2: Explain closure.**  
A: A function has access to variables outside its scope due to lexical scoping.

**Q3: What's the difference between `==` and `===`?**  
A: `==` does type coercion, `===` checks type equality too.

**Q4: Explain the event loop.**  
A: JavaScript executes synchronous code, then microtasks, then macrotasks.

**Q5: What are promises?**  
A: Objects representing eventual completion of async operations.

### Practice Problems

1. **Reverse a string**
2. **Find duplicate in array**
3. **Flatten nested array**
4. **Implement array methods** (map, filter, reduce)
5. **Debounce function**
6. **Currying implementation**
7. **Deep clone object**
8. **Event delegation**
